        <h2>Getting Rid of Ocean Pollution</h2>

        <div class="img-box">

        <p>
            Ocean pollution is a major problem that harms marine life, human health, and the Earth's ecosystem.
            Every year, huge amounts of waste—plastics, chemicals, oil, and sewage—enter the ocean from human
            activities and ocean industries. Fishing, shipping, and oil drilling release harmful substances that
            damage coral reefs, kill marine animals, and make the ocean unsafe for both wildlife and people.
        </p>

        <h2>Introducing the HydraClean Sentinel</h2>

        <div class="img-box">
            <img src="assets/images/HydraCleanSentinel.png"
                alt="Futuristic ocean-cleaning robot concept">
        </div>

        <p>
            The HydraClean Sentinel is an ocean-saving robot designed to collect trash and absorb harmful
            substances from the water. Its mechanical claws and nets scoop up floating waste quickly and
            efficiently, while a floating intake tube removes dangerous pollutants like petrol from the surface.
        </p>

        <p>
            Powered entirely by solar energy, the HydraClean Sentinel can operate day and night—cleaning the ocean
            while charging itself. Fast, efficient, eco‑friendly, and built for the future.
        </p>
