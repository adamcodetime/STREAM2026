        <h2>Solving Ocean Pollution</h2>

        <p>
            Solving ocean pollution is a goal many are aiming to solve, but it isn’t easy so that is why I am going to tell you ways to help solve it.
            For example: we should be throwing waste, shopping wisely, using less water, and raising awareness. By combining these individual actions with community cleanup, and innovative technologies, we can reduce the flow of pollutants in our ocean.
            The types of innovative technologies we can use are solar-powered interceptors, plastic collecting robots, and satellite monitoring systems. All of these can help us to remove a major amount of waste over the years.

        <h2>Introducing the HydraClean Sentinel</h2>

        <div class="img-box">
            <img src="assets/images/HydraCleanSentinel.png"
                alt="Futuristic ocean-cleaning robot concept">
        </div>

        <p>
            The HydraClean Sentinel is an ocean-saving robot designed to collect trash and absorb harmful
            substances from the water. Its mechanical claws and nets scoop up floating waste quickly and
            efficiently, while a floating intake tube removes dangerous pollutants like petrol from the surface.
        </p>

        <p>
            Powered entirely by solar energy, the HydraClean Sentinel can operate day and night—cleaning the ocean
            while charging itself. Fast, efficient, eco‑friendly, and built for the future.
        </p>
        <h2>Why we need to take action</h2>
        <p>
            The ocean provides us with oxygen, food, and climate regulation, as it's a major part of the Earth's oxygen, supplying us with billions of proteins, and resources. But it faces threats from pollution, over-fishing, and climate change.

        <h2>Our Mathematical Calculations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If the HydraClean Sentinel travels at 5 km/h, it can cover 50 km in 10 hours or up to 120 km in 24 hours (Distance = Speed × Time). If it cleans a 10-meter-wide strip (0.01 km).</li>
            <li>Then in one full day it can cover about 1.2 km² of ocean (Area = Distance × Width), and if it collects around 50 kg of waste per kilometer, it could remove about 6,000 kg (6 tonnes) per day. </li>
            <li>Its efficiency can be calculated using Efficiency (%) = (Waste Collected ÷ Maximum Capacity) × 100, so collecting 6,000 kg out of a 7,000 kg capacity would mean about 85.7% efficiency.</li>
            <li>If the machine costs $2 million to build and lasts 10 years, that equals about $200,000 per year or roughly $548 per day to operate, helping estimate long-term cost effectiveness. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>We made sure that our machine would be as sustainable as it’s efficient.</p>
